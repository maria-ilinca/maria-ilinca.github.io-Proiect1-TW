<h2 id="H1" >Short information on the film</h2>
<pre>
Ratatouille is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. 

The eighth film produced by Pixar, it was written and directed by Brad Bird, who took over from Jan Pinkava in 2005, and produced by Brad Lewis, from an original idea from Bird, Pinkava and Jim Capobianco. 

The title refers to the French dish ratatouille, which is served at the end of the film, and also references the species of the main character, a rat. 

Set in Paris, the plot follows the rat named Remy, who dreams of becoming a chef and tries to achieve his goal by forming an alliance with a Parisian restaurant's garbage boy.

<h2 id="H2">Plot</h2>
<pre>
Remy, a young rat with a perfect sense of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his idol, the late Auguste Gusteau. The rest of his colony, including his brother Émile and his father, the clan leader Django, are interested in food only for sustenance. The rats live in the attic of an elderly woman's house in Paris. When Remy and Émile accidentally reveal the colony to the woman they are forced to flee, and Remy is separated from the others. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he eventually finds himself above the kitchen of Gusteau's Restaurant.

Remy notices the restaurant's garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini to uphold Gusteau's motto, "Anyone Can Cook". Skinner demands Linguini replicate the soup to keep his job. Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Once they're alone, Linguini discovers that Remy can understand him, and he convinces Remy to help him cook at Gusteau's.

Remy guides Linguini's movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque. They recreate the soup and continue cooking at Gusteau's. Colette begrudgingly trains Linguini but comes to appreciate someone heeding her professional advice. Remy reunites with Émile and the clan. Django tries to convince Remy that it is impossible to change humans' disdainful nature towards rats, but Remy affirms that "change is nature".
  
Skinner learns that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful owner of the restaurant. When Remy discovers the letter in Skinner's office, Skinner chases Remy around Paris to retrieve it, but Remy gives it to Linguini, who forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular; Linguini's life improves and he develops a romantic relationship with Colette.
  
Meanwhile, Anton Ego, a food critic whose negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau's death, learns of its rising success and announces he will dine at the restaurant. After Linguini takes credit for Remy's cooking, he and Remy have a falling out. Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries for food. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, furiously drives all of the rats out, Remy included.

The next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but promptly freed by Django and Émile. Linguini reconciles with Remy and reveals the truth to his staff, who feel betrayed and walk out. Having been reminded of Gusteau's motto, Colette returns to help. Django and the clan assist, cooking under Remy's direction while Linguini waits tables. When Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, they are bound and gagged. Remy creates a variation of ratatouille which reminds Ego of his mother's cooking. Asking to meet the chef, he is told to wait until the restaurant is empty. Ego is stunned upon being introduced to Remy. He writes a glowing review stating that he has come to understand Gusteau's motto, and describes Remy—without revealing that he is a rat—as "nothing less than the finest chef in France".
  
When Skinner and the health inspector are released the restaurant is shut down, stripping Ego of his credibility and job. Remy, Linguini and Colette open a bistro, La Ratatouille, to continue Gusteau's legacy, in which Ego invests and frequently visits. The rat colony settles into the bistro's attic as their new home.
